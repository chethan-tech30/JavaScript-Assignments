        <h3>Question 6:</h3>
        <p>Rewrite the function using '?' or '||'</p>
        <p>Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number – ask them to input again.</p>
        <p>The loop must ask for a nuSmber until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the input/enters an empty line.</p>
        <p>Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There’s no need to implement a special handling for a non-numeric input in this task.</p>

        <h3>Question 7:</h3>
        <p>An integer number greater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything except 1 and itself.</p>
        <p>In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it can’t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n.</p>
        <p>For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by 2, 3 and 4.</p>
        <p><b>Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.</b></p>
        <p>For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.</p>
        <p>P.S. The code should work for any n, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value</p>
